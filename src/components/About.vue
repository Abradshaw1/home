    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a first-year Master student at Cornell Tech. I recieved my B.E degree in Software Engineering from Tsinghua University on 2024.  
        Previously, I worked with <a href="https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/people/hanspeter-pfister">Prof. Hanspeter Pfister</a> at Harvard University Vision Computing Group on diffusion-based image editing and video understanding.
        I was also a student intern at System Intelligence Group, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/">Microsoft Research Asia</a> working on LLM reasoning supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UUyVnqgAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Xueting Han</a>.
        Currently, I am collaborating with <a href="https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/">Prof. Ming-Hsuan Yang</a> on 3D/4D editing tasks.<br><br>
        
        As a (not that professional) video creator, I think images and videos are fun! My research interest is enhancing multi-modal models' ability on visual reasoning tasks, such as image/video editing and vision fundation models.
        Besides, I'd love for you to subscribe to my <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/15085238?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0">Bilibili</a> channel!
